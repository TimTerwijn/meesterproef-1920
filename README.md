## Debriefing
I am going to build a student portal for the organization Goed Georganiseerd Onderwijs. They are an organization of the HVA that works with students to improve the school.

The GGO has already researched a bit what they and their users want for this student portal application. The students of the HVA would like to have the following information and features inside of the application:

### Information
#### Primary information
* Schedule
* Course info
* Grades
* Education Progress
* Urgent
* Statements

#### Secondary information
* Team sites
* Teacher contact information
* Events

#### Tertiary information
* link to A-Z list
* link to Brightspace
* link to SIS
* Link to education manual
* Link to library
* Link to education page
* Link to HvA addresses
* Link to HvA organization.

#### questions
* Waar moet mail komen?
* Waar moet news komen?

### Features
* All information must be available on one location.
* MijnHvA.nl and MijnHvApp must contain the same information and must look and feel the same as the new app.
* The portal looks and apps must be customizable by a user.
* Students wants to receive push notifications when changes occur in their schedule, when they receive a new grade and when a course has new information.
* Course overview must have a link to brightspace.
* All customizable options and settings must be visible on one page.
* Customizable and personal news.
* Customizable push notifications, both layout and the content.

### Final notes
* The app must be actual, real time, personal and school related.
* Students wants to know the difference between news en Statements.
* Absence of teachers is only useful when the app is real time.
* Schedule needs to have holidays and deadlines.
